This addon will allow you to export GEM2 game engine PLY and VOL files. It also creates a Scene.txt file to help you write the MDL file.
To export VOL files you need to add 'volume' as a custom property to mesh data (not object).
If the model was flipped after exporting, try checking 'Mirror' in export settings.
